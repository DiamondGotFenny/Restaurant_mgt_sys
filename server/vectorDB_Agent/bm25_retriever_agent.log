Very tasty.
The green 
beans with pork were the best dish; the steamed buns were a bit boring.
Servings were s ubstantial; this is good value for the price.
The waiter 
who took our order was surly, but the rest of the staff was pleasant 
enough.

prawns.
Restaurant: Xian Famous Foods Chinatown;  
Neighborhood: Chinatown;  
Grade: A, date: September 2014, Comments: Chinese.
Interesting and 
intensively flavored food.
The noodl es were a special treat, as was the 
spicy lamb burger.
Servings were ample, and prices were dirt cheap.
It’s 
really a lot of fun, but note that it is seriously no frills.
By no frills, I 
mean no waiters, no free water, no reservations, plastic forks, and 
communal tables.
Of course, no credit cards either.

There was a lot of stuff on the menu that didn’t appeal to me 
(e.g., pig ’s head), but there were plenty of dishes for those with more 
conventional tastes.
Grade: A+, Date: January 2017, Comments: Everything was tasty.
Try 
the noodles with chicken (a little bit on the spicy side), the ribs, and the 
prawns.
Also loved the coconu t rice.
The service was super efficient.
The 
music was too loud, but the food was so good that I didn’t care.

I wish the music hadn't been so loud, but it was still possible
