Unlike many Japanese       ramen shops that adapt to a semi -Taiwanese taste after coming  to Taiwan, New       York's ramen is an authentic feast for both taste and vision.      Fortunately, after       introducing my boyfriend to ramen and him falling in love with it, we became       great partners in our ramen exploration team.      Mr. Taka Ramen was our first summer ramen investigation mission last year after       reading detailed media reports and consistently high online reviews.      My boyfriend       and I both prefer rich or even spicy broths, and Mr. Taka Ramen is famous for       its extremely rich pork bone or fish and chicken bro ths, which suit our tastes       perfectly.

In their early days when       they were still operating mobile hand -drip coffee from trucks, every time I       wandered near Astor Place around 8th Street in Lower Manhattan, I could smell a       rich coffee aroma from afar, and I would involuntarily walk towards a corner of       the square  to queue up and buy.      MUD's text logo has an alternative witty and energetic feel, and the main visual       color uses orange to show high morale.      The uniformly orange trucks look even       more dazzling under the sunlight, which was one of the main reasons that att racted       me to join the tasting for the first time.      Receiving the coffee brewed from their       self-roasted coffee beans from the cheerful and enthusiastic baristas, with a       brief smile and eye contact, their sincere vitality quickly spreads to the       surroundings.

As their reputation gradually grew, MUD's self -made ground coffee beans began to       be available in several supermarkets in the East Village, and later they quietly        settled in First Park (also known as MUD PARK) in the Lower East Side.      A corner       pavilion in the park transformed into the MUD counter, combining an open kitchen,       checkout, and serving area.      I love their simple, colorful slogans reminding us that beautiful  things are       everywhere, carefully decorated with green plants, signature orange umbrellas,       and lemon -yellow high stools, making the relaxing atmosphere in the lush park       even more lazy and comfortable, with coffee fragrance lingering.
