\nNew York's Lower East Side  \n \nCentered around the Delancey Street/Essex Street subway station, New York's Lower \nEast Side (LES) spreads out from this point.\nAdjacent to the expanding Manhattan \nChinatown, I love the intersection of old and new flavors in LES, with a strong \nmix of Eastern and Western influences.\nCompared to Midt own or Uptown, there's a \nmore lively and friendly down -to-earth feel here, always welcoming you with open \narms.\nEspecially on a pleasant summer day under the bright sun, strolling along \nthe Western -style streets, alternating between sips of refreshing cold  brew \ncoffee or fresh and delicious bubble tea, you can lazily and casually wander \nalong.\nUnexpectedly, you'll seamlessly transition into Asian shopping streets \nlined with Chinese signs, or stumble upon a synagogue with Chinese -inspired \ndecorations.\nSuch colorful collisions feel perfectly natural, a unique charm of downtown New \nYork.\nSpecialty shops, snacks, original design art, diverse cultural flavors, \nand bustling streets each possess multiple fresh faces, whether trendy and novel, \ncharming and cute, or  bold and bizarre, mixed with intriguing elements that defy \neasy categorization, brimming with vibrant energy.\nEvery time I visit the Lower East Side, I always have some fixed target \nrestaurants and shops in mind to try or revisit, but each time there are  \nunexpected new surprises waiting around the corner.\nThe following places, whether \nmust-visit historic establishments or newly popular Instagram check -in spots, \nare all feasts that satisfy both taste and visual senses, with perfect dining \nscenes.\nI recomme nd that if you have the chance to visit this area of New York, \ndon't miss out on these delicious treats!\n\nSource: A Guide to New York City_Bumble and bumble University Edition.pdf\nPage: 11\n212.274.0008  \nCan you guess t heir favorite ingredient?\nA wide variety of fruity, sweet and/or

well a s GF paninis.\nBRUNCH \nBrunch is a New York institution.\nOptions abound, from the simple to the opulent \n(and if you like, the very boozy).\nThe downside - crowds and long waits are a \nregular occurrence.\nArrive early if you don’t want to wait.\nCLINTON STREET BAKING COMPANY  \n4 Clinton Street  \n646.602.6263  \nFamous for their perfect pancakes, they also offer a bunch of other great \nbreakfast items.\nThe wait for a table is often over an hour (sometimes two).\nThe following restaurants/bars already recommended on this l ist are great for \nbrunch too:  \n44 & X \nBBAR AND GRILL  \nCAFÉ GITANE  \nJACK’S WIFE FREDA  \nTHE PARK  \nSCHILLER’S LIQUOR BAR  \nWESTVILLE  \nCHEERS \nA note about going out: NYC runs on a 24/7 schedule – you can find people out \nin most parts of Manhattan at any hour of the day or night.\nBars stay open until \n4am, and more than a few restaurants stay open 24 hours.\nThe crowds are smaller \nearlier in the week (Sunday - Tuesday) and tend to include locals.\nShowing ID at \nthe door is customary, as is tipping (at least a dollar per drink).\nMEATPACKING DISTRICT/CHELSEA/WEST VILLAGE  \nThe neighborhood we call home sprouts a new bar every day (or so it seems).\nHere \nare our favorites:  \nBARS \nBAR VELOCE  \n176 Seventh Avenue  \n212.629.5300  \nTiny but stylish European -style wine bar.\nSpecializing in Italian wines.\nBIERGARTEN

Street subway station, New York's Lower \nEast Side (LES) spreads out from this point.\nAdjacent to the expanding Manhattan \nChinatown, I love the intersection of old and new flavors in LES, with a strong \nmix of Eastern and Western influences.\nCompared to Midt own or Uptown, there's a \nmore lively and friendly down -to-earth feel here, always welcoming you with open \narms.\nEspecially on a pleasant summer day under the bright sun, strolling along \nthe Western -style streets, alternating between sips of refreshing cold  brew \ncoffee or fresh and delicious bubble tea, you can lazily and casually wander \nalong.\nUnexpectedly, you'll seamlessly transition into Asian shopping streets \nlined with Chinese signs, or stumble upon a synagogue with Chinese -inspired \ndecorations.\nSuch colorful collisions feel perfectly natural, a unique charm of downtown New \nYork.\nSpecialty shops, snacks, original design art, diverse cultural flavors, \nand bustling streets each possess multiple fresh faces, whether trendy and novel, \ncharming and cute, or  bold and bizarre, mixed with intriguing elements that defy \neasy categorization, brimming with vibrant energy.\nEvery time I visit the Lower East Side, I always have some fixed target \nrestaurants and shops in mind to try or revisit, but each time there are  \nunexpected new surprises waiting around the corner.\nThe following places, whether \nmust-visit historic establishments or newly popular Instagram check -in spots, \nare all feasts that satisfy both taste and visual senses, with perfect dining \nscenes.\nI recomme nd

Shenzhen, where the decor was ancient -style and very atmospheric.\nToday's \nrestaurant is in the Lower East Side of New York, and the decor is modern, which \ndoesn't look as ap pealing.\nThis Gui Kitchen is the only one in the entire United \nStates, so if you're traveling to New York, it's worth trying.\nMany of the dishes \nare delicious, but some are relatively ordinary.\nLet's take a look at the pictures \nbelow!\nThis cold skin sells  well, but the taste is really, really, really bland, and \nit's very ordinary to eat.\nIt's not that it's not tasty, but I personally wouldn't \nrecommend this dish.\nPersonal rating: 5/10  \nSnail noodle  is a famous food in Liuzhou, and it is also one of the sig nature \ndishes recommended at Gui Kitchen.\nI've heard from many people that Snail noodle  \nsmells bad, so I wanted to try it.\nIf you can't eat spicy food, you can choose \nless spicy.\nThe noodles have a very fragrant flavor, but the crispy chips on top \nare not crispy enough and too thick, which is a bit of a shame.\nPersonal rating: 6/10  \nThis roast chicken is highly recommended.\nAlthough it's roasted, the meat inside \nis very tender and not dry at all.\nI personally think it's even better than the \none I had at Lao  Ma Que last time, but the decor at Lao Ma Que is really more \nspecial.\nPersonal rating: 8/10  \nThis sweet and sour pork with fried egg is highly recommended.\nThere's some \ntomato sauce on top and more tomato sauce on the bottom, which allows the fried \negg to absorb the tomato sauce.\nIt tastes sweet and sour, very appetizing.\nThe \nonly downside is that the diced meat on top is really delicious, but there's \nvery little of it.\nPersonal rating: 9/10  \nIn addition to these dishes, I'd also like to mention that the w aiter gave us a \nfew complimentary drinks and desserts this time, which made me very happy.\n\nSource: Gui Kitchen reviews.pdf\nPage: 4\nis \nnot particularly Liuzhou style, but the half

good.\n[Food section]: Really a novel experience!\nGuangxi Old Friend Fish  \nRecommended, the main dish, almost every table orders it.\nThe fish is very tender,  \nwith few bones, and topped with a layer of sour bamboo shoots.\nCan everything  \nin Guangxi be added with sour ba mboo shoots, hahahahaha, the smell is not  \nstrong, the entrance is sour, crispy and refreshing, the fish is very flavorful,  \nretaining the freshness and fragrance.\nI think the sour taste is more, it is \ndelicious.\nOld Friend Beef Offal  \nRecommended dish, the i ngredients and the old friend fish are very similar.\nThe  \nbeef offal and bean sprouts are also soaked in the soup.\nI have only eaten curry  \nbeef offal before, this Guangxi specialty sour bamboo shoot beef offal is also \nvery \ndelicious, it has a magical effect !\nThe soft and tender beef offal is coated \nwith the  \nsoup and eaten together, very appetizing and delicious!\nOsmanthus Honey Roasted Ribs  \nRecommended, the rib skewers are delicious, crispy on the outside and tender on  \nthe inside, honey roasted so slightly s weet.\nGui Kitchen Lemon Duck is also a must -order.\nCaocao35lgh  \n4/5 \n2022-01-08 \nI visit Gui Kitchen every month, and this time I chose the Ningchun City store \nagain.\nThe service is still as warm as ever, and we enjoyed the half -price dish promotion  \non weekdays.\nThe squid and old friend fish are still delicious.\nThe soy sauce  \nchicken and sour soup beef are just average, maybe they don't suit our taste.\nThe \nrice dumplings are getting more and more delicious, the circle of rice should be  \ntaro inside, soft and glutinous, I will try other dim sum next time.\nPIPIU \n5/5 \n2021-11-01 \nEveryone in Guangxi in New York knows about Gui Kitchen, which shows its

isn't extensive, and the dishes are simply \nprepared but often surprisingly  delightful.\nIt brings together home -style dishes \npassed down through generations across Guangxi, each a classic and beloved \ncomfort food.\nFresh, nutritious ingredients combined with traditional techniques \nhave captured the hearts of food lovers, with ever yone having their own must -\norder favorites.\nStir-fried ong choy may seem simple, but it requires great skill.\nI find the ong \nchoy with stems but no leaves to be the most delicious, and it shouldn't be \novercooked.\nCrisp, tender, and flavorful, it's simply the best.\nCrafted by a Michelin -starred chef, the Flaxseed Crispy Duckling features small \nducks raised by the Li River.\nMeticulously roasted, the duckling is tender, \nboneless, and devoid of any gamey odor.\nThe crispy skin is sprinkled with \nnutritious and aromatic flaxseeds.\nDipping it in the sauce and taking a bite, \nskin and meat together, is truly

decoration is considered high -end and dimly lit  \nfor a Chinese restaurant.\nOpen kitchen, looks professional and clean.\nThe price is okay, you can definitely eat well for 100 yuan per person.\nCompared to being ripped off by vendors with chaotic prices in scenic spots,  \nI sincerely recommend you go to the mall to eat at local big -brand restaurants.\n.\nSignature Old Friend Fish,  \nReally boneless, sweet, every table orders it, suitable for all ages.\nFlaxseed Crispy Duckling,  \nFragrant, crispy and plump, with a strong sesame aroma, it does need sour plum  \njuice to relieve the greasiness.\nBeautifully presented, the taste is also refreshing.\nSour Bamboo Shoot and Perilla Fried Beef  \nLocal home -style dish, very good with rice.\nSmall Sea food Steamed Fresh Bean Curd Skin  \nThis combination is amazing, it looks light,  \nActually has some spiciness, the taste is really good.\n.\nBecause it was really full, the serving speed was not so fast.\nHowever,

\nYork's ramen is an authentic feast for both taste and vision.\nFortunately, after \nintroducing my boyfriend to ramen and him falling in love with it, we became \ngreat partners in our ramen exploration team.\nMr. Taka Ramen was our first summer ramen investigation mission last year after \nreading detailed media reports and consistently high online reviews.\nMy boyfriend \nand I both prefer rich or even spicy broths, and Mr. Taka Ramen is famous for \nits extremely rich pork bone or fish and chicken bro ths, which suit our tastes \nperfectly.\nWe became regulars after our first try.\nOn our first visit, we ordered the SPICY \nMISO ramen and SPICY TONKOTSU ramen, with TAKA'S WINGS AND DRUMS as an appetizer.\nChef Takatoshi Nagara's ramen shop in Tokyo is liste d in the Michelin Tokyo Ramen \nTOP 20, and his exquisite skills are particularly evident in the broth and \nappetizer sauce preparations.\nThe spicy ramen is full of flavor but still allows \nyou to taste 100% of the perfect rich broth.\nThe abundant toppings are  all fresh \nand flavorful, and the handmade thin noodles are perfectly chewy, fully absorbing \nthe essence of the soup, making us fascinated and eating non -stop until we see \nthe bottom of the bowl.\nThe fried chicken wings and drumsticks are juicy and \ndelicious when bitten into, with the pickled sauce's sweet and sour flavors \nperfectly penetrating the meat, while the fresh yuzu and sesame flavors reduce \nthe greasiness considerably.\nAlthough you'll almost always have to queue at any time on weekends or holidays  \nwhen visiting Mr. Taka Ramen, this delicious food is definitely worth the wait.\nKatz's Deli  \nEstablished in 1888, Katz's Deli is a super senior food veteran in New York.\n\nSource:

Delicious Restaurants and Stylish Shops in \nNew York's Lower East Side  \n \nCentered around the Delancey Street/Essex Street subway station, New York's Lower \nEast Side (LES) spreads out from this point.\nAdjacent to the expanding Manhattan \nChinatown, I love the intersection of old and new flavors in LES, with a strong \nmix of Eastern and Western influences.\nCompared to Midt own or Uptown, there's a \nmore lively and friendly down -to-earth feel here, always welcoming you with open \narms.\nEspecially on a pleasant summer day under the bright sun, strolling along \nthe Western -style streets, alternating between sips of refreshing cold  brew \ncoffee or fresh and delicious bubble tea, you can lazily and casually wander \nalong.\nUnexpectedly, you'll seamlessly transition into Asian shopping streets \nlined with Chinese signs, or stumble upon a synagogue with Chinese -inspired \ndecorations.\nSuch colorful collisions feel perfectly natural, a unique charm of downtown New \nYork.\nSpecialty shops, snacks, original design art, diverse cultural flavors, \nand bustling streets each possess multiple fresh faces, whether trendy and novel, \ncharming and cute, or  bold and bizarre, mixed with intriguing elements that defy \neasy categorization, brimming with vibrant energy.\nEvery time I visit the Lower East Side, I always have some fixed target \nrestaurants and shops in mind to try or revisit, but each time there are  \nunexpected new surprises waiting around the corner.\nThe following places, whether \nmust-visit historic establishments or newly popular Instagram check -in spots, \nare all feasts that satisfy both taste and visual senses, with perfect dining \nscenes.\nI recomme nd that if you have the chance to visit this area of New York, \ndon't miss out on

delicious treats!\nSugar Sweet Sunshine  \nSugar Sweet Sunshine is a sweet and unpretentious dessert shop, just like its \nname suggests, giving people a warm and comfortab le feeling like sunshine.\nIt \nmainly sells adorable and memorable cupcakes and puddings.\nEvery time I come \nhere, I feel the joy of being invited into a cozy living room.\nA large floor -to-\nceiling window at the entrance reflects the bright and refreshing stre et outside \nwith its sunny green foliage.\nIn the small shop of less than 100 square feet, \nthe irresistible aroma of sweet but not cloying scents fills the air, and the \nglistening sugar frosting on the cupcakes in the display window shines with an \nalluring g low.\n\nSource: Local New Yorker's Secret List_by Cherie Chen.pdf\nPage: 3\nThe open preparation area is within arm's reach.\nI love to occasionally turn my \nhead to observe the meticulous handcrafting process of the staff while chatting \nwith my girlfriends, watching them work their magic to create beautiful and \ndelicious eye -catching products from scratch.\nThe shop's partners are all adorable and friendly dessert ambassadors, always \nwearing sweet smiles and enthusiastically introducing and explaining to first -\ntime customers.\nThe walls are thoughtfully covered with photos of cus tomers and \nstaff, along with casual hand -drawn slogans and lively animal doodles.\nSugar Sweet Sunshine's desserts are moderately sized, with sweetness reduced by \nhalf compared to the overly sweet American desserts I remember.\nEven if you want \nto indulge an d try multiple flavors, ordering 2 -3 varieties at once is definitely \nnot a problem.\nThe Lemon Yummy and Ooey Gooey cupcakes are classic flavors that \nI must try every time I visit the shop, while the banana pudding is a popular \nitem recommended by many on s ocial media, which I plan to try on my next visit \nto LES in two weeks.\nBar GATO  \nBAR GATO is a trendy urban Japanese izakaya that my boyfriend and I accidentally \ndiscovered during our regular visits to this area early last autumn.\nWe always \nenjoy trying Asian specialties or fusion flavors; it's not hard to guess the \nstrong Japanese origins of this izakaya from its minimalist yet powerful black \nand gold exterior wall or its name, GATO.\nBAR GATO is small and exquisite, elegantly divided into two areas: one is a bar \narea with a warm and elegant wood texture, where crystal -clear glassware and \nwine selections are neatly arranged; the other is an extended seating area in \nthe same color scheme, with thoughtfully placed velvet sofa seats along the wall \nand charmin g Japanese crane wallpaper.\nOn our first visit, since we had just had breakfast not long ago, we asked the \nstaff to recommend a

Spring Street #A\n\nSource: Local New Yorker's Secret List_by Cherie Chen.pdf\nPage: 9\nMUD Coffee  \nI can proudly say that I am a loyal fan of MUD coffee.\nIn their early days when \nthey were still operating mobile hand -drip coffee from trucks, every time I \nwandered near Astor Place around 8th Street in Lower Manhattan, I could smell a \nrich coffee aroma from afar, and I would involuntarily walk towards a corner of \nthe square  to queue up and buy.\nMUD's text logo has an alternative witty and energetic feel, and the main visual \ncolor uses orange to show high morale.\nThe uniformly orange trucks look even \nmore dazzling under the sunlight, which was one of the main reasons that att racted \nme to join the tasting for the first time.\nReceiving the coffee brewed from their \nself-roasted coffee beans from the cheerful and enthusiastic baristas, with a \nbrief smile and eye contact, their sincere vitality quickly spreads to the \nsurroundings.\nThe fair bitterness that spreads in the mouth, and the warm coffee \naroma permeates everywhere.\nAs their reputation gradually grew, MUD's self -made ground coffee beans began to \nbe available in several supermarkets in the East Village, and later they quietly  \nsettled in First Park (also known as MUD PARK) in the Lower East Side.\nA corner \npavilion in the park transformed into the MUD counter, combining an open kitchen, \ncheckout, and serving area.\nI love their simple, colorful slogans reminding us that beautiful  things are \neverywhere, carefully decorated with green plants, signature orange umbrellas, \nand lemon -yellow high stools, making the relaxing atmosphere in the lush park \neven more lazy and comfortable, with coffee fragrance lingering.\nWhether it's snowing o r a clear sky, it's suitable to come here for a cup of \ncoffee, sit down surrounded by greenery and joyful crowds, and quietly replenish \nthe caffeine in your body.\nIt's not that MUD coffee is really that expert and \nextreme, what I cherish more should be tha t familiar aftertaste, with bittersweet \nmemories sparkling here and there.\n\nSource: Local New Yorker's Secret List_by Cherie Chen.pdf\nPage: 3\nThe open preparation area is within arm's reach.\nI love to occasionally turn my \nhead to observe the meticulous handcrafting process of the staff while chatting \nwith my girlfriends, watching them work their magic to create beautiful and \ndelicious eye -catching products from scratch.\nThe shop's partners are all adorable and friendly dessert ambassadors, always \nwearing sweet smiles and enthusiastically introducing and explaining to first -\ntime customers.\nThe walls are thoughtfully covered with photos of cus tomers and \nstaff, along with casual hand -drawn slogans and lively animal doodles.\nSugar Sweet Sunshine's desserts are moderately sized, with sweetness reduced by \nhalf compared to the overly sweet American desserts I remember.\nEven if you want \nto indulge an d try multiple flavors, ordering 2 -3 varieties at once is definitely \nnot a problem.\nThe Lemon Yummy and Ooey Gooey cupcakes are classic flavors that \nI must try every time I visit the shop, while the banana pudding is a popular \nitem recommended by many on s ocial media, which I plan to try on my next visit \nto LES in two weeks.\nBar GATO  \nBAR GATO is a trendy urban Japanese izakaya that my boyfriend and I accidentally \ndiscovered during our regular visits to this area early last autumn.\nWe always \nenjoy trying Asian specialties or fusion flavors; it's not hard to guess the \nstrong Japanese origins of this izakaya from its minimalist yet powerful black \nand gold exterior wall or its name, GATO.\nBAR GATO is small and exquisite, elegantly divided into two areas: one is a bar \narea with a warm and elegant wood texture, where crystal -clear glassware and \nwine selections are neatly arranged; the other is an extended seating area in \nthe same color scheme, with thoughtfully placed velvet sofa seats along the wall \nand charmin g Japanese crane wallpaper.\nOn our first visit, since we had just had breakfast not long ago, we asked the \nstaff to recommend a few appetizers.\n\nSource: A Guide to New York City_Bumble and bumble University Edition.pdf\nPage: 9\n17 Prince Street  \n212.625.2001  \nCuban joint, famed for its Mexican -style corn.\nSmall but

everyone.\n\nSource: New York Gui kitchen Diary.pdf\nPage: 1\nNew York Food Diary ~ #GuiKitchen #GuangxiCuisine  \nThis is my second time eating at Gui Kitchen.\nThe first time was at Happy Coast \nin Shenzhen, where the decor was ancient -style and very atmospheric.\nToday's \nrestaurant is in the Lower East Side of New York, and the decor is modern, which \ndoesn't look as ap pealing.\nThis Gui Kitchen is the only one in the entire United \nStates, so if you're traveling to New York, it's worth trying.\nMany of the dishes \nare delicious, but some are relatively ordinary.\nLet's take a look at the pictures \nbelow!\nThis cold skin sells  well, but the taste is really, really, really bland, and \nit's very ordinary to eat.\nIt's not that it's not tasty, but I personally wouldn't \nrecommend this dish.\nPersonal rating: 5/10  \nSnail noodle  is a famous food in Liuzhou, and it is also one of the sig nature \ndishes recommended at Gui Kitchen.\nI've heard from many people that Snail noodle  \nsmells bad, so I wanted to try it.\nIf you can't eat spicy food, you can choose \nless spicy.\nThe noodles have a very fragrant flavor, but the crispy chips on top \nare not crispy enough and too thick, which is a bit of a shame.\nPersonal rating: 6/10  \nThis roast chicken is highly recommended.\nAlthough it's roasted, the meat inside \nis very tender and not dry at all.\nI personally think it's even better than the \none I had at Lao  Ma Que last time, but the decor at Lao Ma Que is really more \nspecial.\nPersonal rating: 8/10  \nThis sweet and sour pork with fried egg is highly recommended.\nThere's some \ntomato sauce on top and more tomato sauce on the bottom, which allows the fried \negg to absorb the tomato sauce.\nIt tastes sweet and sour, very appetizing.\nThe \nonly downside is that the diced meat on top is really delicious, but there's \nvery little of it.\nPersonal rating: 9/10  \nIn addition to these dishes, I'd also like to mention that the w aiter gave us a \nfew complimentary drinks and desserts this time, which made me very happy.\n\nSource: Gui Kitchen reviews.pdf\nPage: 5\nThe service of the waiters and waitresses is very good.\n[Food section]: Really a novel experience!\nGuangxi Old Friend Fish  \nRecommended, the main dish, almost every table orders it.\nThe fish is very tender,  \nwith few bones, and topped with a layer of sour bamboo shoots.\nCan everything  \nin Guangxi be added with sour ba mboo shoots, hahahahaha, the smell is not  \nstrong, the entrance is sour, crispy and refreshing, the fish is very flavorful,  \nretaining the freshness and fragrance.\nI think the sour taste is more, it is \ndelicious.\nOld Friend Beef Offal  \nRecommended dish, the i ngredients and the old friend fish are very similar.\nThe  \nbeef offal and bean sprouts are also soaked in the soup.\nI have only eaten curry  \nbeef offal before, this Guangxi specialty sour bamboo shoot beef offal is also \nvery \ndelicious, it has a magical effect !\nThe soft and tender beef offal is coated \nwith the  \nsoup and eaten together, very appetizing and delicious!\nOsmanthus Honey Roasted Ribs  \nRecommended, the rib skewers are delicious, crispy on the outside and tender on  \nthe inside, honey roasted so slightly s weet.\nGui Kitchen Lemon Duck is also a must -order.\nCaocao35lgh  \n4/5 \n2022-01-08 \nI visit Gui

friend fish are still delicious.\nThe soy sauce  \nchicken and sour soup beef are just average, maybe they don't suit our taste.\nThe \nrice dumplings are getting more and more delicious, the circle of rice should be  \ntaro inside, soft and glutinous, I will try other dim sum next time.\nPIPIU \n5/5 \n2021-11-01 \nEveryone in Guangxi in New York knows about Gui Kitchen, which shows its

\nEast Side (LES) spreads out from this point.\nAdjacent to the expanding Manhattan \nChinatown, I love the intersection of old and new flavors in LES, with a strong \nmix of Eastern and Western influences.\nCompared to Midt own or Uptown, there's a \nmore lively and friendly down -to-earth feel here, always welcoming you with open \narms.\nEspecially on a pleasant summer day under the bright sun, strolling along \nthe Western -style streets, alternating between sips of refreshing cold  brew \ncoffee or fresh and delicious bubble tea, you can lazily and casually wander \nalong.\nUnexpectedly, you'll seamlessly transition into Asian shopping streets \nlined with Chinese signs, or stumble upon a synagogue with Chinese -inspired \ndecorations.\nSuch colorful collisions feel perfectly natural, a unique charm of downtown New \nYork.\nSpecialty shops, snacks, original design art, diverse cultural flavors, \nand bustling streets each possess multiple fresh faces, whether trendy and novel, \ncharming and cute, or  bold and bizarre, mixed with intriguing elements that defy \neasy categorization, brimming with vibrant energy.\nEvery time I visit the Lower East Side, I always have some fixed target \nrestaurants and shops in mind to try or revisit, but each time there are  \nunexpected new surprises waiting around the corner.\nThe following places, whether \nmust-visit historic establishments or newly popular Instagram check -in spots, \nare all feasts that satisfy both taste and visual senses, with perfect dining \nscenes.\nI recomme nd that if you
